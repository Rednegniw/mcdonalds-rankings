## About this project

Hi! This is a [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/) project that aims to showcase how to use the [Google Places API](https://developers.google.com/places/web-service/overview) to find the best McDonald's near you.

You can:

- Search for a place by name
- Search in your current location
- Filter by radius and open now
- See the user ratings of the places

I made it for fun, mainly to learn Svelte as I never used it before.

## Tech stack

It is made with:

- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/)
- [Bits UI](https://bitsui.org/)
- [Google Places API](https://developers.google.com/places/web-service/overview)

## Roadmap

Currently, I don't have any plan to add to it, but feel free to create a PR if you want to add something.

Currently, it is deployed on <a href="https://bestmcdonalds.com" target="_blank">bestmcdonalds.com</a>. Hopefully it won't have much traffic, since Google Places API is pretty expensive.
