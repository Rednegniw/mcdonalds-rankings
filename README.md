## About this project

Hi! This is a [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/) project that aims to showcase how to use the [Google Places API](https://developers.google.com/places/web-service/overview) to find the best McDonald's near you.

I made it for fun, mainly to learn Svelte as I never used it before.

It is made with:

- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/)
- [Bits UI](https://bitsui.org/)
- [Google Places API](https://developers.google.com/places/web-service/overview)

Currently, I don't have any plan to add to it, but feel free to create a PR if you want to add something.

Currently, it is deployed on [bestmcdonalds.com](https://bestmcdonalds.com). Hopefully it won't have much traffic, since Google Places API is pretty expensive. If so, I will take it down.
